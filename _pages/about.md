Hi, I'm Brody! I am a senior at the University of Hawaii majoring in Computer Science. I'm currently helping forecast hydrological streamflows with machine learning as a research assistant.

Prior to becoming a research assistant, I interned as an AI research intern with Oceanit Technologies. I also had the pleasure of interning with multiple financial institutions from a quantitative hedge fund in Florida to a large investment bank in New York.

Apart from work, I enjoy surfing, music, and learning. My interests include artifical intelligence, computer vision, photography, and the financial markets. 

If you have any questions, I can be reached at <brodyuehara@gmail.com>.
