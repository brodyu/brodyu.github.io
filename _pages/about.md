Hello. My name is Brody, and I am a Senior studying Computer Science at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. My passions lie in the intersection of finance and artificial intelligence. Currently, I am a Undergraduate Researcher with the Univeristy of Hawaii exploring artificial intelligence ethics.

Apart from work, I love hiking and surfing in Hawaii.
