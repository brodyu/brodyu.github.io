<p>As the United States and most of Western Europe battle the COVID-19 crisis, normal life for most people has come to a halt. Many states in America are going into lockdown and forcing
  millions of Americans to shelter in place. This black swan event has prompted many investors to speculate on almost all facets of industries affected by the crisis. Today, I will discuss
  the industries that are often overlooked from most investors but still have room for speculation.</p>

# Google Trends

<p>To analyze trends, we will use Google Trends, a free platform developed by Google to analyze the popularity of search queries and topics utilizing Google Search. Google
  Trends will allow us to quickly see what is trending and where we want to possibly investment. The best part about Google Trends is that I can quickly add the
  scripts to any HTML page, like this one, for you to view.</p>

# Working From Home

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic caused millions of workers across America to start working from home. While most will probably return back to work in a
  few months, we will definitely see a new generation of permanent remote workers. The pandemic has forced many businesses to adapt and now employers are
  starting to see the feasibility of remote work.</p>

<p>One of the most obvious winners from the work at home trend is computer hardware companies, like AAPL and MSFT. Google search queries for the keywords 'laptop' and 'computer'
  have shot up dramatically. What is surprising is that current search traffic exceeds the amount seen on Christmas and Black Friday. This shows that remote workers and students
  are investing heavily in new laptops and computer gear to make the transition to working at home as seamless as possible.</p>

trends.embed.renderExploreWidget("TIMESERIES", {"comparisonItem":[{"keyword":"laptop","geo":"","time":"today 12-m"},{"keyword":"computer","geo":"","time":"today 12-m"}],
"category":0,"property":""}, {"exploreQuery":"q=laptop,computer&date=today 12-m,today 12-m","guestPath":"https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/"}); </script>

<p>While distributers like Best Buy and semiconductors might also benefit from the rise in computer hardware purchases, the clear winner remains the manufacturers themselves.</p>

<p>One interesting worldwide trend is that 'ipad' and 'macbook' google search queries are sustaining high numbers. Sustained search query numbers are rare and point to the
  possibility of bigger numbers than black friday and christmas season sales.</p>

{"exploreQuery":"q=ipad,macbook&date=today 12-m,today 12-m","guestPath":"https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/"}); </script>

# Pet Adoptions

<p>While many adjust to a new life at home, an interesting and overlooked trend is emerging. People are adopting pets more than ever before. Google Trends shows an exponential increase for the
  search term 'Humane society adopt', which shows people are all over America are interested in adopting and fostering pets during their time in quarantine. Moreover, we can speculate that once a pet is
  adopted, they will remain in the household for years to come.</p>

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/trends_nrtr/2152_RC02/embed_loader.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">
trends.embed.renderExploreWidget("TIMESERIES", {"comparisonItem":[{"keyword":"Humane society adopt","geo":"US","time":"today 12-m"}],"category":0,"property":""},
{"exploreQuery":"geo=US&q=Humane%20society%20adopt&date=today 12-m","guestPath":"https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/"}); </script>

## Chewy

<p>One of the potential winners from the surge in pet adoptions is Chewy, an online retailer of pet food and pet-related products. In the midst of quaratine, Chewy's e-commerce platform
  is provided a huge opportunity for growth and a whole new potential customer base.</p>

<p>Google Trends search traffic for Chewy.com has seen record levels from previous declining 12-month searches.</p>

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/trends_nrtr/2152_RC02/embed_loader.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript"> trends.embed.renderExploreWidget("TIMESERIES",
{"comparisonItem":[{"keyword":"chewy.com","geo":"US","time":"today 12-m"},{"keyword":"chewy promo code","geo":"US","time":"today 12-m"}],"category":0,"property":""},
{"exploreQuery":"geo=US&q=chewy.com,chewy%20promo%20code&date=today 12-m,today 12-m","guestPath":"https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/"}); </script>

<p>Chewy's current price is up 15% for the month due to a rise in all e-commerce related platforms because of the COVID-19 crisis. However, Chewy stands out from the crowd by targeting
  the pet industry. I dont believe investors are valuing Chewy on the basis of pet adoptions, but only for its e-commerce platform, which makes this play overlooked. Chewy has a huge growth
  opportunity if they are able to capitalize and retain this new incoming customer base.</p>

# Gaming

<p>The gaming industry has seen a huge rise in daily active users since the start of the outbreak in early May. While, many gaming companies have seen a reduction in share price during this time, they were not hit nearly as hard as the rest of the market. The two companies that have capitalized on this new customer base are Activision Blizzard ($ATVI) with the release of Call of Duty Warzone, a brand new battle royal game for the Modern Warfare title, and Nintendo ($NTDOY) with their release of Animal Crossing New Horizons, a social simulation game that provides an outlet for many during this difficult time.</p>

## Activision Blizzard

<p>Activision Blizzard has outperformed when it comes to making great first-person shooters, and Call of Duty Modern Warfare is a great example. The game is constantly updating with new content to keep players hooked for a long time. When the COVID-19 outbreak began, ATVI capitalized on the opportunity by releasing their take on a battle royal style game, Call of Duty Warzone. Warzone attracted 30 million players in the first 10 days of its release.</p>

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/trends_nrtr/2152_RC04/embed_loader.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript"> trends.embed.renderExploreWidget("TIMESERIES", {"comparisonItem":[{"keyword":"cod warzone","geo":"US","time":"today 12-m"},{"keyword":"cod","geo":"US","time":"today 12-m"},{"keyword":"call of duty","geo":"US","time":"today 12-m"},{"keyword":"call of duty warzone","geo":"US","time":"today 12-m"}],"category":0,"property":""}, {"exploreQuery":"geo=US&q=cod%20warzone,cod,call%20of%20duty,call%20of%20duty%20warzone&date=today 12-m,today 12-m,today 12-m,today 12-m","guestPath":"https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/"}); </script>

<p>With the constantly updating battle passes for Call of Duty Modern Warfare and the release of Warzone, ATVI has set itself apart from its competitors like EA.</p>
