# Introduction
This project is a quick way to aggregate tweets and perform sentiment analysis. The goal of this project was to learn the overall sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of a particular topic on Twitter. Utilizing the official Twitter API and several natural language processing libraries such as TextBlob, we are able to gain insight into general public sentiment quickly and efficiently. Senitment Analysis is a huge field of natural language processing research. The advances in the field are utilized in a wide variety of industries from marketing to finance. 

# Requirements
This library utilizes a number of libraries to automate data capture and analysis. These specific libraries and their function is listed below:
* Twitter API: In order to use Twitter's API, you need to sign up for a developer account and submit a project proposal for the API keys. Click on the link [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en) to sign up for a developer account.
* Tweepy: The Tweepy library is used to authenticate the Twitter API
* TextBlob: is a pretrained NLP model that we will run across our tweets. 

# Implementation
